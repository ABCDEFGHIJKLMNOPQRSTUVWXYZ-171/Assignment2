    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey, Iâ€™m Ahaliya! I was born and raised in Kuwait, but now Iâ€™m living in Dubai. The transition was pretty smooth â€” same desert, just a bigger, faster city. Dubaiâ€™s got a lot to offer, and Iâ€™m here for it. From the city life to the opportunities, itâ€™s been an exciting experience so far.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m just taking it one step at a time, enjoying the ride, and making the most of living in a place like this.</p>

    <h2>ðŸ’¬ Letâ€™s Connect</h2>
    <p>Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or share ideas. Iâ€™m always open to connecting.</p>
